I did not care then and I do not care now. Unfortunately, in much the same way that I had to learn about the BCPE distribution in order to understand the [GAMLSS regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_additive_model_for_location,_scale_and_shape) framework that I'm going to talk about in the [next post](/posts/2025-09-07_gamlss/), so much so that my BCPE notes became their own post, I have fallen prey to my own vices and again found myself through the looking glass, shaving an unhappy yak, and writing about a topic very different to the one I originally intended to. \n\nOh well.\n\n\n\nA [spline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spline_(mathematics)) is just a piecewise polynomial. Partition the interval $[a, b]$ into $k$ subintervals defined by **knot** points that demark the edges of each interval. The $i$-th subinterval is the region $[t_{_i-1}, t_i]$ and \n\n$$\na = t_0 \\leq t_1 \\leq t_2 \\leq \\ldots \\leq t_k = b\n$$\n\n",
