I loathe regular expressions, and I am not good at them. So why am I, a grotesquely unqualified woman, writing one anyway? Honestly, the answer is because __this post is the tutorial that I need__. I'm writing this as an act of kindness for future Danielle, who will find inevitably herself crying at her keyboard trying to make a basic regex work, and will need to remind herself of the basics. With that in mind, and knowing exactly who will be revisiting this post in six months time in tears... you got this girl. I believe in you. \n\n## Simple matches\n\nIt begins with the very, very basics. The simplest way to write a regular expression is to detect strings that match a specific, fixed subset of text. For instance, let's say I want to find every line in [Femininomenon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdaKBAuO8zg) in which Chappell Roan sings the word `\"femininomenon\"`. I'll use the `str_view()` function from the stringr package to do this. It's not the best tool for using in a script, but it's ideal as a way of looking at the results of a regular expression match:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstr_view(\n  string = femininomenon,   # the song lyrics\n  pattern = \"femininomenon\" # the regular expression\n)\n```\n\n<pre>[24] │ (It's a fem) It's a <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;femininomenon&gt;</span>\n[28] │ (It's a fem) It's a <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;femininomenon&gt;</span>\n[53] │ (It's a fem) It's a <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;femininomenon&gt;</span>\n[57] │ (It's a fem) It's a <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;femininomenon&gt;</span>\n[65] │ Well, what we really need is a <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;femininomenon&gt;</span>\n[66] │ (A what?) A <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;femininomenon&gt;</span>\n[72] │ (It's a fem) It's a <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;femininomenon&gt;</span>\n[82] │ (It's a fem) It's a <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;femininomenon&gt;</span>\n[86] │ (It's a fem) It's a <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;femininomenon&gt;</span>\n[90] │ Make a bitch, it's a fem (It's a <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;femininomenon&gt;</span>)\n</pre>\n:::\n\n\n\nIn this output, the teal-highlighted text^[At the R console, this highlighting appears automatically. Normally you wouldn't see this highlighting in a quarto document like this one, because quarto strips out the ANSI control characters that the console uses to add colour to the output. However, for the purposes of this post I cheated a little, by writing a [knitr hook](/posts/2023-12-30_knitr-hooks/) that crudely mimics the same behaviour in this document.] enclosed in angle brackets displays the sections of the text that match the regular expression. In this case our regular expression is very simple. It's just a literal string `\"femininomenon\"`, so the output highlights every instance of that word. \n\nNotice also that not every line in the song is shown by `str_view()`. Only those lines that match the regular expression are included (you can see that in the numbers to the left of each match). However, we can change this behaviour using the `match` argument to `str_view()`. For example, if wanted to see only those lines that don't include the letter `e`, we could do this:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstr_view(\n  string = femininomenon,\n  pattern = \"e\", \n  match = FALSE\n)\n```\n\n<pre>[11] │ Why can't any man\n[12] │ \n[19] │ \n[20] │ [Chorus]\n[29] │ \n[40] │ Why can't any man\n[41] │ \n[48] │ \n[49] │ [Chorus]\n[58] │ \n[67] │ \n[77] │ \n[78] │ [Chorus]\n[87] │ \n[88] │ [Outro]\n</pre>\n:::\n\n\n\nAlternatively, we could set `match = NA`. If we do this, `str_view()` will return every line in the song, whether it matches or not. Here's an example. Let's search for every instance of the word `\"you\"`, and set `match = NA`:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstr_view(\n  string = femininomenon,\n  pattern = \"you\",\n  match = NA\n)\n```\n\n<pre> [1] │ [Verse 1]\n [2] │ Same old story, time again\n [3] │ Got so close but then <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;you&gt;</span> lost it\n [4] │ Should've listened to <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;you&gt;</span>r friends\n [5] │ 'Bout his girlfriend back in Boston\n [6] │ You sent him pictures and playlists and phone sex\n [7] │ He disappeared from the second that <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;you&gt;</span> said\n [8] │ \"Let's get coffee, let's meet up\"\n [9] │ I'm so sick of online love\n[10] │ And I don't understand\n[11] │ Why can't any man\n[12] │ \n[13] │ [Pre-Chorus]\n[14] │ Hit it like, get it hot\n[15] │ Make a bitch, it's a fem\n[16] │ Hit it like, get it hot\n[17] │ Make a bitch, it's a—\n[18] │ Um, can <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;you&gt;</span> play a song with a fucking beat?\n[19] │ \n[20] │ [Chorus]\n... and 72 more\n</pre>\n:::\n\n\n\nThis output illustrates two things. First, you can see that there's a match on lines 3, 4, 7, 18, and probably others too (the remaining 72 lines of the song aren't shown in the output but they are actually included in the `str_view()` output). Second, it shows that our regular expression isn't quite doing the job we want it to: the match on line 4 matches the first three letters of the word \"your\", and it doesn't match to line 6 because that line contains the word \"You\" with an upper case \"Y\". If we want a regular expression to match \"you\" and \"You\" but not match against \"your\", it needs to be something a little more nuanced than setting `pattern = \"you\"` like I did above. \n\n## Quantifiers\n\nFor the moment, let's set aside the thorny question of how to handle capitalisation, and focus instead on the \"you\" vs \"your\" issue. Moreover, let's move the goalposts, and pretend that our new goal is actually to detect *both* `\"you\"` and `\"your\"`. We can do that with the help of **quantifiers**. In regular expression syntax, certain character (sometimes called \"metacharacters\") have special meanings. For example, the `?` character is used to indicate that the preceding character is optional. When we write `\"your?\"` as our regular expression, the `r?` part indicates that the `r` character is optional. It will match against both `\"you\"` and `\"your\"`:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstr_view(femininomenon, \"your?\")\n```\n\n<pre> [3] │ Got so close but then <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;you&gt;</span> lost it\n [4] │ Should've listened to <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;your&gt;</span> friends\n [7] │ He disappeared from the second that <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;you&gt;</span> said\n[18] │ Um, can <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;you&gt;</span> play a song with a fucking beat?\n[33] │ Lying to <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;your&gt;</span> friends about\n[35] │ Stuck in the suburbs, <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;you&gt;</span>'re folding his laundry\n[36] │ Got what <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;you&gt;</span> wanted, so stop feeling sorry\n[47] │ Dude, can <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;you&gt;</span> play a song with a fucking beat?\n[60] │ Ladies, <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;you&gt;</span> know what I mean\n[61] │ And <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;you&gt;</span> know what <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;you&gt;</span> need\n[76] │ Did <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;you&gt;</span> hear me? Play the fucking beat\n</pre>\n:::\n\n\n\nHere you can see that it matches the `\"you\"` on line 3 and the `\"your\"` on line 4. However, on line 35 where it encounters the word `\"you're\"` it detects a match, but *only* to the `\"you\"` part of the word.  \n\nThere are several quantifiers supported by most regular expression flavours.^[There are a ghastly number of different regular expression flavours out there. They are very similar to each other, but have subtle differences. Somewhat frustratingly, there are *three* different regular expression flavours that are widely used in R (two in base R and one in tidyverse), and every now and then I find myself running into cases where they don't produce identical results. More on this later in the post.] Quantifiers always refer to the previous item, and specify the number of repetitions of the previous item that can be matched: \n\n- `?` matches the previous item zero or one time\n- `*` matches the previous item zero or more times\n- `+` matches the previous item one or more times\n- `{n}` matches the previous item exactly n times\n- `{n,}` matches the previous item n or more times\n- `{n,m}` matches the previous item at least n times but not more than m times\n\nThis behaviour is (of course!) described in numerous places in the R documentation, but I find it helps a lot to have a concrete example that shows the differences between each of these. In the table below, the rows correspond to the strings `\"a\"`, `\"ab\"`, `\"abb\"`, and so on. Each column corresponds to a a regular expression that is always `\"ab\"` with a quantifier applied to the letter `\"b\"`. In each cell of the table, I've used `str_view()` to show how each string matches (or doesn't match) against each of the regexes:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\ntibble(\n  string    = c(\"a\", \"ab\", \"abb\", \"abbb\", \"abbbb\", \"abbbbb\"),\n  `ab?`     = str_view(string, pattern = \"ab?\", match = NA),\n  `ab*`     = str_view(string, pattern = \"ab*\", match = NA),\n  `ab+`     = str_view(string, pattern = \"ab+\", match = NA),\n  `ab{2}`   = str_view(string, pattern = \"ab{2}\", match = NA),\n  `ab{2,}`  = str_view(string, pattern = \"ab{2,}\", match = NA),\n  `ab{2,4}` = str_view(string, pattern = \"ab{2,4}\", match = NA)\n)\n```\n\n<pre># A tibble: 6 × 7\n  string `ab?`      `ab*`      `ab+`      `ab{2}`    `ab{2,}`   `ab{2,4}` \n  <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;chr&gt;</span>  <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;strngr_v&gt;</span> <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;strngr_v&gt;</span> <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;strngr_v&gt;</span> <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;strngr_v&gt;</span> <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;strngr_v&gt;</span> <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;strngr_v&gt;</span>\n1 a      <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;a&gt;</span>        <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;a&gt;</span>        a          a          a          a         \n2 ab     <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;ab&gt;</span>       <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;ab&gt;</span>       <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;ab&gt;</span>       ab         ab         ab        \n3 abb    <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;ab&gt;</span>b      <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;abb&gt;</span>      <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;abb&gt;</span>      <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;abb&gt;</span>      <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;abb&gt;</span>      <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;abb&gt;</span>     \n4 abbb   <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;ab&gt;</span>bb     <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;abbb&gt;</span>     <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;abbb&gt;</span>     <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;abb&gt;</span>b     <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;abbb&gt;</span>     <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;abbb&gt;</span>    \n5 abbbb  <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;ab&gt;</span>bbb    <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;abbbb&gt;</span>    <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;abbbb&gt;</span>    <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;abb&gt;</span>bb    <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;abbbb&gt;</span>    <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;abbbb&gt;</span>   \n6 abbbbb <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;ab&gt;</span>bbbb   <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;abbbbb&gt;</span>   <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;abbbbb&gt;</span>   <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;abb&gt;</span>bbb   <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;abbbbb&gt;</span>   <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;abbbb&gt;</span>b  \n</pre>\n:::\n\n\n\nNotice that these are all **eager** (sometimes called **greedy**), in the sense that they will always match to as many repetitions as they possibly can while satisfying the rules. However, you can reverse this behaviour and make a quantifier **lazy** by appending  `?` immediately after the quantifier. A lazy quantifier will match against the fewest number of repetitions as it can possibly can while satisfying the rule. Here's what that looks like:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\ntibble(\n  string    = c(\"a\", \"ab\", \"abb\", \"abbb\", \"abbbb\", \"abbbbb\"),\n  `ab??`     = str_view(string, pattern = \"ab??\", match = NA),\n  `ab*?`     = str_view(string, pattern = \"ab*?\", match = NA),\n  `ab+?`     = str_view(string, pattern = \"ab+?\", match = NA),\n  `ab{2}?`   = str_view(string, pattern = \"ab{2}?\", match = NA),\n  `ab{2,}?`  = str_view(string, pattern = \"ab{2,}?\", match = NA),\n  `ab{2,4}?` = str_view(string, pattern = \"ab{2,4}?\", match = NA)\n)\n```\n\n<pre># A tibble: 6 × 7\n  string `ab??`     `ab*?`     `ab+?`     `ab{2}?`   `ab{2,}?`  `ab{2,4}?`\n  <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;chr&gt;</span>  <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;strngr_v&gt;</span> <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;strngr_v&gt;</span> <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;strngr_v&gt;</span> <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;strngr_v&gt;</span> <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;strngr_v&gt;</span> <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;strngr_v&gt;</span>\n1 a      <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;a&gt;</span>        <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;a&gt;</span>        a          a          a          a         \n2 ab     <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;a&gt;</span>b       <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;a&gt;</span>b       <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;ab&gt;</span>       ab         ab         ab        \n3 abb    <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;a&gt;</span>bb      <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;a&gt;</span>bb      <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;ab&gt;</span>b      <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;abb&gt;</span>      <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;abb&gt;</span>      <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;abb&gt;</span>     \n4 abbb   <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;a&gt;</span>bbb     <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;a&gt;</span>bbb     <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;ab&gt;</span>bb     <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;abb&gt;</span>b     <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;abb&gt;</span>b     <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;abb&gt;</span>b    \n5 abbbb  <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;a&gt;</span>bbbb    <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;a&gt;</span>bbbb    <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;ab&gt;</span>bbb    <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;abb&gt;</span>bb    <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;abb&gt;</span>bb    <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;abb&gt;</span>bb   \n6 abbbbb <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;a&gt;</span>bbbbb   <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;a&gt;</span>bbbbb   <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;ab&gt;</span>bbbb   <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;abb&gt;</span>bbb   <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;abb&gt;</span>bbb   <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;abb&gt;</span>bbb  \n</pre>\n:::\n\n\n\nObviously, some of those are silly. There's no point whatsoever in writing a regular expression like `ab{2,4}?`, because it produces exactly the same behaviour as `ab{2}`.\n\n## Groups\n\nSuppose we want something a little fancier. Let's say, I want to find every line in which she sings either \"fem\" or \"femininomenon\". To do this, we wrap each of these strings in parentheses to define **groups**,^[Specifically, these are \"capturing\" groups because this syntax supports \"backreferencing\", which will come up later. This can be distinguished from \"non-capturing\" groups that can be written using slightly different syntax, but in all honesty I almost always use capturing groups because I'm lazy.] and use the `|` to indicate that the string can match against either of these groups. So our regular expression becomes `\"(femininomenon)|(fem)\"`:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstr_view(femininomenon, \"(femininomenon)|(fem)\")\n```\n\n<pre>[15] │ Make a bitch, it's a <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;fem&gt;</span>\n[24] │ (It's a <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;fem&gt;</span>) It's a <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;femininomenon&gt;</span>\n[28] │ (It's a <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;fem&gt;</span>) It's a <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;femininomenon&gt;</span>\n[44] │ Make a bitch, it's a <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;fem&gt;</span>\n[53] │ (It's a <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;fem&gt;</span>) It's a <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;femininomenon&gt;</span>\n[57] │ (It's a <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;fem&gt;</span>) It's a <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;femininomenon&gt;</span>\n[65] │ Well, what we really need is a <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;femininomenon&gt;</span>\n[66] │ (A what?)

It varies across engines, but from an R perspective you can use `\\A` to match the start of a match group (i.e., it works simularly to `^`) and `\\Z` to match the end, similar to `$`. So this is another way of detecting the first word in a line, as long as it starts with `L`:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstr_view(femininomenon, \"\\\\AL[a-zA-z]*\")\n```\n\n<pre>[33] │ <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;Lying&gt;</span> to your friends about\n[60] │ <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;Ladies&gt;</span>, you know what I mean\n</pre>\n:::\n\n\n\n## Backslash escape\n\nNotice that in the last section I used `\\A` in the text to refer to the anchor, but used `\"\\\\A\"` in the R string used to specify it. This is because R uses `\\` as the \"escape\" character, and so if you want to insert a literal `\\` into an R string then you need to escape it:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncat(\"\\\\A\")\n```\n\n<pre>\\A\n</pre>\n:::\n\n\n\nTo unpack it slightly more:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nslashes <- c(\n  \"This R string contains a single literal backslash \\\\\", \n  \"This R string contains two literal backslashes, \\\\ and \\\\\",\n  \"This R string has one linebreak character \\n but no backslashes\"\n)\ncat(slashes, sep = \"\\n\")\n```\n\n<pre>This R string contains a single literal backslash \\\nThis R string contains two literal backslashes, \\ and \\\nThis R string has one linebreak character \n but no backslashes\n</pre>\n:::\n\n\n\nThe headache when using regular expressions is that `\\` is *also* the escape character in the regex. That is, if you want your regular expression to match a literal `\\`, then the regular expression itself needs to be `\\\\`. And if you want to describe it as an R string, then you need to escape both of those too, so the string that specifies the regular expression is now `\"\\\\\\\\\"`. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncat(\"\\\\\\\\\")\n```\n\n<pre>\\\\\n</pre>\n:::\n\n\n\nHere's what I mean:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstr_view(slashes, \"\\\\\\\\\", match = NA)\n```\n\n<pre>[1] │ This R string contains a single literal backslash <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;\\&gt;</span>\n[2] │ This R string contains two literal backslashes, <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;\\&gt;</span> and <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;\\&gt;</span>\n[3] │ This R string has one linebreak character \n    │  but no backslashes\n</pre>\n:::\n\n\n\nCharacters that have special syntactic meaning need to be escaped if you want to treat them as literals. Quantifiers, for example:\n\n- write `\"\\\\+\"` in R to mean `\\+` in the regex and match a literal `+`\n- write `\"\\\\.\"` in R to mean `\\.` in the regex and match a literal `.`\n- write `\"\\\\?\"` in R to mean `\\?` in the regex and match a literal `?`\n- write `\"\\\\*\"` in R to mean `\\*` in the regex and match a literal `*`\n- write `\"\\\\{\"` in R to mean `\\{` in the regex and match a literal `{`\n\nIt obviously follows that since `\\` is used as the escape character it too must be escaped if you want to treat it as a literal:\n\n- write `\"\\\\\\\\\"` in R to mean `\\\\` in the regex and match a literal `\\`\n\nA little more subtle is the fact that *opening* (left) braces, brackets, and parentheses need to be escaped...\n\n- write `\"\\\\[\"` in R to mean `\\[` in the regex and match a literal `]`\n- write `\"\\\\(\"` in R to mean `\\(` in the regex and match a literal `]`\n- write `\"\\\\{\"` in R to mean `\\{` in the regex and match a literal `]`\n\nBut... while the same logic applies to a closing *parenthesis* `)`, it is *not* true for closing brackets `]` or braces `}`. Those two are treated as literals and should not be escaped:\n\n- write `\"]\"` in R to mean `]` in the regex and match a literal `]`\n- write `\"\\\\)\"` in R to mean `\\)` in the regex and match a literal `)`\n- write `\"}\"` in R to mean `}` in the regex and match a literal `}`\n\nThis is subtle enough that it's worth a couple of examples. Let's say I want to detect all instances of the bracketed literal text `[Chorus]` in the \"Feminomenon\" lyrics.

At [regular-expressions.info](https://regular-expressions.info), for instance, you can find quick lookup tables for a wide variety of different regular expression engines. It lists [regular expressions in R](https://www.regular-expressions.info/rlanguage.html) as one of those systems, but it's important to remember that this refers to the syntax used by base R tools like `grep()`, `gsub()`, `gregexpr()` and so on. Or, more precisely, it refers to the default POSIX standard for extended regular expressions. Base R actually supports two different engines, so if you set `perl = TRUE` when calling base R functions then you would need to look at the [rules for PCRE](https://www.regular-expressions.info/pcre.html). In tidyverse, regular expressions are usually handled with the [stringr](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/) package that is built on top of [stringi](https://stringi.gagolewski.com/), which in turn uses the [ICU](https://icu.unicode.org/) engine that conforms to Unicode standards and as such provides comprehensive Unicode support. The [stringi regular expressions](https://stringi.gagolewski.com/weave/regular_expressions.html) page has a nice discussion. \n\nLike an idiot, I forget this on a semi-regular basis, and I try to debug something by looking up the wrong regex syntax and yes, this sometimes matters. For instance, in the help documentation for regex in base R, you can find some discussion of various predefined POSIX classes (e.g., `\"[[:alpha:]]\"` matches alphabetic characters, `[[:digit:]]` matches numeric digits, and `\"[[:punct:]]\"` matches punctuation characters). However, different engines interpret these classes differently, which means you'll sometimes get different results depending on which engine you use.^[It also depends on the system locale. Not surprising, of course, but that does add to the sheer chaos of it all.]\n\nTo illustrate this I'll use an example that I have shamelessly stolen directly from the [stringi documentation](https://stringi.gagolewski.com/weave/regular_expressions.html#avoiding-posix-classes), in order to show how very differently `\"[[:punct:]]\"` is interpreted across the three most commonly used regex engines in R. But first, because I cannot even with the base R regular expression syntax,^[I mean, wtf. I am genuinely sympathetic to R core, and deeply appreciate their willingness to maintain backward compatibility even for the bits of R that are just bizarre. But oh my god.] I'll define a `base_extract_all()` function that is roughly analogous to `stringr::str_extract_all()`, but uses the base R functions to do the work:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbase_extract_all <- function(string, pattern, perl = FALSE) {\n  matches <- gregexpr(pattern = pattern, text = string, perl = perl)\n  regmatches(x = string, m = matches)\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nNext, I'll define a string `punct` containing a lot of punctuation characters:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npunct <- \",./|\\\\<>?;:'\\\"[]{}-=_+()*&^%$€#@!`~×‒„”\"\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nSo, what happens when we match `punct` to `\"[[:punct:]]\"`? Well, it depends heavily on which engine you're using. If you're using ERE (i.e., base R with `perl = FALSE`), you get this as the result:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbase_extract_all(punct, \"[[:punct:]]\")\n```\n\n<pre>[[1]]\n [1] \",\"  \".\"  \"/\"  \"|\"  \"\\\\\" \"<span style='color:#008080'>&lt;\"  \"&gt;</span>\"  \"?\"  \";\"  \":\"  \"'\"  \"\\\"\" \"[\"  \"]\" \n[15] \"{\"  \"}\"  \"-\"  \"=\"  \"_\"  \"+\"  \"(\"  \")\"  \"*\"  \"&\"  \"^\"  \"%\"  \"$\"  \"€\" \n[29] \"#\"  \"@\"  \"!\"  \"`\"  \"~\"  \"×\"  \"‒\"  \"„\"  \"”\" \n</pre>\n:::\n\n\n\nWhat about PCRE?
