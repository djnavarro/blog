A femininomenon\n</pre>\n:::\n\n\n\nNot intending this to be a tutorial on regular expressions, but it's probably not a bad idea to very briefly talk about the descent into madness. The simplest form of regular expression is finding strings that match a specific, fixed subset of text. For instance, here's every line in \"Femininomenon\" in which Chappell Roan says `\"femininomenon\"`:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstr_view(femininomenon, \"femininomenon\")\n```\n\n<pre>[24] │ (It's a fem) It's a <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;femininomenon&gt;</span>\n[28] │ (It's a fem) It's a <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;femininomenon&gt;</span>\n[53] │ (It's a fem) It's a <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;femininomenon&gt;</span>\n[57] │ (It's a fem) It's a <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;femininomenon&gt;</span>\n[65] │ Well, what we really need is a <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;femininomenon&gt;</span>\n[66] │ (A what?)

Let's say, I want to find every line in which she sings either `\"fem\"` or `\"femininomenon\"`. To do this, we wrap each of these strings in parentheses to define **groups**,^[Specifically, these are \"capturing\" groups because this syntax supports \"backreferencing\", which will come up later. This can be distinguished from \"non-capturing\" groups that can be written using slightly different syntax, but in all honesty I almost always use capturing groups because I'm lazy.] and use the `\"|\"` to indicate that the string can match against either of these groups. So our regular expression becomes `\"(femininomenon)|(fem)\"`:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstr_view(femininomenon, \"(femininomenon)|(fem)\")\n```\n\n<pre>[15] │ Make a bitch, it's a <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;fem&gt;</span>\n[24] │ (It's a <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;fem&gt;</span>) It's a <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;femininomenon&gt;</span>\n[28] │ (It's a <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;fem&gt;</span>) It's a <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;femininomenon&gt;</span>\n[44] │ Make a bitch, it's a <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;fem&gt;</span>\n[53] │ (It's a <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;fem&gt;</span>) It's a <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;femininomenon&gt;</span>\n[57] │ (It's a <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;fem&gt;</span>) It's a <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;femininomenon&gt;</span>\n[65] │ Well, what we really need is a <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;femininomenon&gt;</span>\n[66] │ (A what?)

There are several quantifiers supported by most regular expression flavours. Quantifiers always refer to the previous item, and specify the number of repetitions of the previous item that can be matched: \n\n- `?` matches zero or one time\n- `*` matches zero or more times\n- `+` matches one or more times\n- `{n}` matches exactly n times\n- `{n,}` matches n or more times\n- `{n,m}` matches at least n times but not more than m times\n\nHere's a little demonstration:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\ntibble(\n  string    = c(\"a\", \"ab\", \"abb\", \"abbb\", \"abbbb\", \"abbbbb\"),\n  `ab?`     = str_view(string, pattern = \"ab?\", match = NA),\n  `ab*`     = str_view(string, pattern = \"ab*\", match = NA),\n  `ab+`     = str_view(string, pattern = \"ab+\", match = NA),\n  `ab{2}`   = str_view(string, pattern = \"ab{2}\", match = NA),\n  `ab{2,}`  = str_view(string, pattern = \"ab{2,}\", match = NA),\n  `ab{2,4}` = str_view(string, pattern = \"ab{2,4}\", match = NA)\n)\n```\n\n<pre># A tibble: 6 × 7\n  string `ab?`      `ab*`      `ab+`      `ab{2}`    `ab{2,}`   `ab{2,4}` \n  <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;chr&gt;</span>  <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;strngr_v&gt;</span> <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;strngr_v&gt;</span> <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;strngr_v&gt;</span> <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;strngr_v&gt;</span> <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;strngr_v&gt;</span> <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;strngr_v&gt;</span>\n1 a      <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;a&gt;</span>        <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;a&gt;</span>        a          a          a          a         \n2 ab     <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;ab&gt;</span>       <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;ab&gt;</span>       <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;ab&gt;</span>       ab         ab         ab        \n3 abb    <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;ab&gt;</span>b      <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;abb&gt;</span>      <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;abb&gt;</span>      <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;abb&gt;</span>      <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;abb&gt;</span>      <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;abb&gt;</span>     \n4 abbb   <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;ab&gt;</span>bb     <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;abbb&gt;</span>     <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;abbb&gt;</span>     <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;abb&gt;</span>b     <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;abbb&gt;</span>     <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;abbb&gt;</span>    \n5 abbbb  <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;ab&gt;</span>bbb    <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;abbbb&gt;</span>    <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;abbbb&gt;</span>    <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;abb&gt;</span>bb    <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;abbbb&gt;</span>    <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;abbbb&gt;</span>   \n6 abbbbb <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;ab&gt;</span>bbbb   <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;abbbbb&gt;</span>   <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;abbbbb&gt;</span>   <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;abb&gt;</span>bbb   <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;abbbbb&gt;</span>   <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;abbbb&gt;</span>b  \n</pre>\n:::\n\n\n\nNotice that these are all \"greedy\", and the maximum number of repetitions is used whenever possible.\n\nSo, to return to the femininomenon example, we could use `\"fem(ininomenon)?\"` as the regular expression and it will do the same job: \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstr_view(femininomenon, \"fem(ininomenon)?\")\n```\n\n<pre>[15] │ Make a bitch, it's a <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;fem&gt;</span>\n[24] │ (It's a <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;fem&gt;</span>) It's a <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;femininomenon&gt;</span>\n[28] │ (It's a <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;fem&gt;</span>) It's a <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;femininomenon&gt;</span>\n[44] │ Make a bitch, it's a <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;fem&gt;</span>\n[53] │ (It's a <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;fem&gt;</span>) It's a <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;femininomenon&gt;</span>\n[57] │ (It's a <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;fem&gt;</span>) It's a <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;femininomenon&gt;</span>\n[65] │ Well, what we really need is a <span style='color:#008080'>&lt;femininomenon&gt;</span>\n[66] │ (A what?)

At [regular-expressions.info](https://regular-expressions.info), for instance, you can find quick lookup tables for a wide variety of different regular expression engines. It lists [regular expressions in R](https://www.regular-expressions.info/rlanguage.html) as one of those systems, but it's important to remember that this refers to the syntax used by base R tools like `grep()`, `gsub()`, `gregexpr()` and so on. Or, more precisely, it refers to the default POSIX standard for extended regular expressions. Base R actually supports two different engines, so if you set `perl = TRUE` when calling base R functions then you would need to look at the [rules for PCRE](https://www.regular-expressions.info/pcre.html). In tidyverse, regular expressions are usually handled with the [stringr](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/) package that is built on top of [stringi](https://stringi.gagolewski.com/), which in turn uses the [ICU](https://icu.unicode.org/) engine that conforms to Unicode standards and as such provides comprehensive Unicode support. The [stringi regular expressions](https://stringi.gagolewski.com/weave/regular_expressions.html) page has a nice discussion. \n\nLike an idiot, I forget this on a semi-regular basis, and I try to debug something by looking up the wrong regex syntax and yes, this sometimes matters. For instance, in the help documentation for regex in base R, you can find some discussion of various predefined POSIX classes (e.g., `\"[[:alpha:]]\"` matches alphabetic characters, `[[:digit:]]` matches numeric digits, and `\"[[:punct:]]\"` matches punctuation characters). However, different engines interpret these classes differently, which means you'll sometimes get different results depending on which engine you use.^[It also depends on the system locale. Not surprising, of course, but that does add to the sheer chaos of it all.]\n\nTo illustrate this I'll use an example that I have shamelessly stolen directly from the [stringi documentation](https://stringi.gagolewski.com/weave/regular_expressions.html#avoiding-posix-classes), in order to show how very differently `\"[[:punct:]]\"` is interpreted across the three most commonly used regex engines in R. But first, because I cannot even with the base R regular expression syntax,^[I mean, wtf. I am genuinely sympathetic to R core, and deeply appreciate their willingness to maintain backward compatibility even for the bits of R that are just bizarre. But oh my god.] I'll define a `base_extract_all()` function that is roughly analogous to `stringr::str_extract_all()`, but uses the base R functions to do the work:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbase_extract_all <- function(string, pattern, perl = FALSE) {\n  matches <- gregexpr(pattern = pattern, text = string, perl = perl)\n  regmatches(x = string, m = matches)\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nNext, I'll define a string `punct` containing a lot of punctuation characters:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npunct <- \",./|\\\\<>?;:'\\\"[]{}-=_+()*&^%$€#@!`~×‒„”\"\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nSo, what happens when we match `punct` to `\"[[:punct:]]\"`? Well, it depends heavily on which engine you're using. If you're using ERE (i.e., base R with `perl = FALSE`), you get this as the result:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbase_extract_all(punct, \"[[:punct:]]\")\n```\n\n<pre>[[1]]\n [1] \",\"  \".\"  \"/\"  \"|\"  \"\\\\\" \"<span style='color:#008080'>&lt;\"  \"&gt;</span>\"  \"?\"  \";\"  \":\"  \"'\"  \"\\\"\" \"[\"  \"]\" \n[15] \"{\"  \"}\"  \"-\"  \"=\"  \"_\"  \"+\"  \"(\"  \")\"  \"*\"  \"&\"  \"^\"  \"%\"  \"$\"  \"€\" \n[29] \"#\"  \"@\"  \"!\"  \"`\"  \"~\"  \"×\"  \"‒\"  \"„\"  \"”\" \n</pre>\n:::\n\n\n\nWhat about PCRE? Let's set `perl = TRUE` and have a look:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbase_extract_all(punct, \"[[:punct:]]\", perl = TRUE)\n```\n\n<pre>[[1]]\n [1] \",\"  \".\"  \"/\"  \"|\"  \"\\\\\" \"<span style='color:#008080'>&lt;\"  \"&gt;</span>\"  \"?\"  \";\"  \":\"  \"'\"  \"\\\"\" \"[\"  \"]\" \n[15] \"{\"  \"}\"  \"-\"  \"=\"  \"_\"  \"+\"  \"(\"  \")\"  \"*\"  \"&\"  \"^\"  \"%\"  \"$\"  \"#\" \n[29] \"@\"  \"!\"  \"`\"  \"~\" \n</pre>\n:::\n\n\n\nOkay yeah that is not even close to being the same thing. But what about the ICU engine? If you're working in tidyverse, internally you're probably relying on this engine and, well...\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstr_extract_all(punct, \"[[:punct:]]\")\n```\n\n<pre>[[1]]\n [1] \",\"  \".\"  \"/\"  \"\\\\\" \"?\"  \";\"  \":\"  \"'\"  \"\\\"\" \"[\"  \"]\"  \"{\"  \"}\"  \"-\" \n[15] \"_\"  \"(\"  \")\"  \"*\"  \"&\"  \"%\"  \"#\"  \"@\"  \"!\"  \"‒\"  \"„\"  \"”\" \n</pre>\n:::\n\n\n\nLe sigh. Of course. \n\n## I'm so sorry for my loss\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfeather <- read_lines(\"feather.txt\")\n\nrules <- tribble(\n              ~pattern, ~replacement,\n    \"([Dd]o)(-[Dd]o)+\",         \"🎶\", # do-do, do-do-do -> musical note\n             \"feather\",         \"🪶\", # feather -> emoji feather\n                \"wine\",         \"🍷\", # wine -> emoji wine\n         \"\\\\([Aa]h\\\\)\",      \"...😌\", # (ah) -> ...emoji relief\n  \"\\\\[([^\\\\[\\\\]]+)\\\\]\",          \"~\"  # replace square bracketed text\n)\n\nstr_rewrite <- function(string, rules) {\n  purrr::reduce2(\n    .x = rules$pattern, \n    .y = rules$replacement, \n    .f = str_replace_all, \n    .init = string\n  )\n}\n\nfeather |> \n  str_rewrite(rules) |> \n  cat(sep = \"\\n\")\n```\n\n<pre>~\n(🎶, 🎶, 🎶, 🎶)\n(🎶, 🎶, 🎶, 🎶)\nOh, not another take\n\n~\nOh, it's like that, I'm your dream come true\nWhen it's on a platter for you\nThen you pull back when I try to make plans\nMore than two hours in advance, mm\n\n~\nI slam the door, I hit ignore\nI'm saying, \"No, no, no, no more\"\nI got you blocked, after this, an afterthought\nI finally cut you off\n\n~\nI feel so much lighter like a 🪶 with you off my mind ...😌\nFloatin' through the memories like whatever, you're a waste of time ...😌\nYour signals are mixed, you act like a bitch\nYou fit every stereotype, \"Send a pic\"\nI feel so much lighter like a 🪶 with you out my life\nWith you out my life\n\n~\n(🎶, 🎶, 🎶, 🎶)\n(🎶, 🎶, 🎶, 🎶)\nLike a 🪶, like a 🪶, like a 🪶, yeah\n\n~\nIt feels so good\nNot carin' where you are tonight\nAnd it feels so good\nNot pretendin' to like the 🍷 you like\n\n~\nI slam the door (Slam the door), I hit ignore (Hit ignore)\nI'm saying, \"No, no, no, no more\"\nI got you blocked, excited to never talk, I\nI'm so sorry for your loss\n\n~\nI feel so much lighter like a 🪶 with you off my mind ...😌\nFloatin' through the memories like whatever, you're a waste of time ...😌\nYour signals are mixed, you act like a bitch (A bitch)\nYou fit every stereotype, \"Send a pic\"\nI feel so much lighter like a 🪶 with you out my life\nWith you out my life\n\n~\n(🎶, 🎶, 🎶, 🎶)\nAh, mm\n(🎶, 🎶, 🎶, 🎶)\nLike a 🪶, like a 🪶, like a 🪶\n\n~\nYou want me?
