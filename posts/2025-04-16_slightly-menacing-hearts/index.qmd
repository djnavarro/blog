<!--------------- post begins here ----------------->

Over the last month or so, while the world burned and my emotions went entirely haywire thanks to the painful process of nicotine withdrawal, I've been posting artwork on social media that eventually became the [slightly menacing hearts](https://art.djnavarro.net/gallery/menacing-hearts/) series. Like most of my generative art series, I made the source code [available on github](https://github.com/djnavarro/series-menacing-hearts), and released a curated set of pieces on my art website. In the past when releasing a series that I particularly like, I've written technical posts on this blog that show how the system is designed (examples [here](/posts/2024-01-26_splatter/), [here](/posts/2023-03-13_shattered-landscapes/), and [here](/posts/2021-09-07_water-colours/)). I thought about doing that again, but honestly I don't think there's much value to it this time because the implementation of the menacing hearts system isn't that much different to the [tutorial on iterated function systems](/posts/2024-12-22_art-from-code-5/) that I wrote a few years ago. From a technical standpoint there's really nothing new to say. 

From an artistic perspective though, there is something missing. For as long as I've been making generative art I've consistently talked about the fact that my creative process is driven by  emotions. Here's [something I wrote](/posts/2021-07-08_generative-art-in-r/) back in 2021:

> Most of the time the starting point for my art is an emotion. I might be angry or lonely or tired, or just in need of something to occupy my mind and distract me from something else. When I start implementing a new system it’s often (though not always) a modification of a previous one. In principle this modification process could go in any direction, but my aesthetic sensibilities depend a lot on my state of mind, and that imposes a bias. I tweak the code one way, and see what it produces. If I like it, I keep the change, if I don’t I reject it. It’s a lot like a Metropolis-Hastings sampler that way, but my mood strongly shapes the accept/reject decision, so the same starting point can lead to different outcomes.

As I wrap the slightly menacing hearts series up, it strikes me that this has been one of the most deeply personal things I've ever done with my art. The emotions that drove this series are tied to trauma, and when I posted individual pieces to mastodon or bluesky I tended to provide captions or titles for the pieces. The captions were often sinister, and those don't appear in the [gallery](https://art.djnavarro.net/gallery/menacing-hearts/). The gallery is just 200 images displayed in a random order. The context is missing, and the audience can't see the progression over time as the series was being developed.

Maybe that doesn't matter. Barthes wasn't wrong when he wrote [the death of the author](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_of_the_Author). Yes, I created the pieces. And yes, my emotions and experiences shape how and why I did that. But those experiences aren't dispositive when interpreting the artwork. I have an interpretation of my work. Others are free to perceive and interpret the same pieces in a different way.

Nevertheless, I'm still going to say something about what the art means to me. So... here goes.
