<!--------------- post begins here ----------------->

Over the last month or so, while the world burned and my emotions went entirely haywire thanks to the painful process of nicotine withdrawal, I've been posting artwork on social media that eventually became the [slightly menacing hearts](https://art.djnavarro.net/gallery/menacing-hearts/) series. Like most of my generative art series, I made the source code [available on github](https://github.com/djnavarro/series-menacing-hearts), and released a curated set of pieces on my art website. In the past when releasing a series that I particularly like, I've written technical posts on this blog that show how the system is designed (examples [here](/posts/2024-01-26_splatter/), [here](/posts/2023-03-13_shattered-landscapes/), and [here](/posts/2021-09-07_water-colours/)). I thought about doing that again, but honestly I don't think there's much value to it this time because the implementation of the menacing hearts system isn't that much different to the [tutorial on iterated function systems](/posts/2024-12-22_art-from-code-5/) that I wrote a few years ago. From a technical standpoint there's really nothing new to say. 

From an artistic perspective though, there is something missing. For as long as I've been making generative art I've consistently talked about the fact that my creative process is driven by  emotions. Here's [something I wrote](/posts/2021-07-08_generative-art-in-r/) back in 2021:

> Most of the time the starting point for my art is an emotion. I might be angry or lonely or tired, or just in need of something to occupy my mind and distract me from something else. When I start implementing a new system it’s often (though not always) a modification of a previous one. In principle this modification process could go in any direction, but my aesthetic sensibilities depend a lot on my state of mind, and that imposes a bias. I tweak the code one way, and see what it produces. If I like it, I keep the change, if I don’t I reject it. It’s a lot like a Metropolis-Hastings sampler that way, but my mood strongly shapes the accept/reject decision, so the same starting point can lead to different outcomes.

As I wrap the slightly menacing hearts series up, it strikes me that this has been one of the most deeply personal things I've ever done with my art. The emotions that drove this series are tied to trauma, and when I posted individual pieces to mastodon or bluesky I tended to provide captions or titles for the pieces. The captions were often sinister, and those don't appear in the [gallery](https://art.djnavarro.net/gallery/menacing-hearts/). The gallery is just 200 images displayed in a random order. The context is missing, and the audience can't see the progression over time as the series was being developed.

Maybe that doesn't matter. Barthes wasn't wrong when he wrote [the death of the author](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_of_the_Author). Yes, I created the pieces. And yes, my emotions and experiences shape how and why I did that. But those experiences aren't dispositive when interpreting the artwork. I have an interpretation of my work. Others are free to perceive and interpret the same pieces in a different way.

Nevertheless, I'm still going to say something about what the art means to me. So... here goes. 

## I. Desire

The series started with a sense of joy and success. The mood partly captured my sense of accomplishment that I'd finally found a way to render the heart motif within this system in a way I found personally satisfying. It's something I'd tried to do in two previous systems ([here](https://art.djnavarro.net/gallery/heart-samples/) and [here](https://art.djnavarro.net/gallery/love-in-the-lightning/)) but with less success than I would have liked. So I was cautiously hopeful when the sixth version of the code started producing pieces I liked. Not quite convinced it was going to work out, I posted this one to social media with the caption **"maybe"**:

![**maybe** (version 06, seed 1504)](https://storage.googleapis.com/djnavarro-art/series-menacing-hearts/image/languid_06_1504.jpg)

Admittedly, my cautious optimism about the system wasn't the only reason for picking this title. I hadn't chosen the heart motif by accident, after all. I wrote this into the code because I was distracted thinking about love, sex, and men. The sexual undercurrent, which became darker and more overt later in the series, was there from the outset. 

The next piece I shared was literally the next image that the system created. The **maybe** piece was generated using the sixth version of the system, and like most of my systems the only input argument is the RNG seed. **maybe** sets the seed to 1504, and the next piece **something** comes from seed 1505. I honestly don't know if the pairing of titles was intentional, but it does occur to me that "maybe [this is] something..." speaks more directly to the feeling I had at the time:

![**something** (version 06, seed 1505)](https://storage.googleapis.com/djnavarro-art/series-menacing-hearts/image/languid_06_1505.jpg)

Like **maybe**, there is something delicate about **something**, but this time there is more energy. The white in the centre of the heart feels like it's glowing to me. It feels joyful to me, slightly dreamy. There is love in the art, and -- not entirely coincidentally -- I was thinking about a man, so when the next iteration of the code produced the image below, it's hardly a surprise that the accompanying caption turned the subtext into the text. This one is **he loves me, he loves me not**:

![**he loves me, he loves me not** (version 07, seed 1674)](https://storage.googleapis.com/djnavarro-art/series-menacing-hearts/image/languid_07_1674.jpg)

I adore this piece. The balance between the orange tones and the blue tones appeals to me, and this was one of the first pieces that made me think about the structural relationship between the "glow" in these images and the boundary defined by the heart motif itself. The way the blue seems to grow outwards from the heart, but then cling to the vertical streaks that run through the piece feels very organic to me. It makes me happy every time I revisit it.

The piece that followed has a slightly different vibe. The red glow in this piece extends further than earlier ones, and the warmth of the red tones is a stark contrast against the dull flat grey background. So when I called it **languid in the afterglow**, yes, it's about sex. Or the bit after sex when you're still happy and warm and safe even if the rest of the world is none of those things. The afterglow that never lasts as long as you want it to. 

![**languid in the afterglow** (version 07, seed 1686)](https://storage.googleapis.com/djnavarro-art/series-menacing-hearts/image/languid_07_1686.jpg)

Sigh. 

In any case, the next piece I shared on social media didn't have an explicit title. The accompanying text wasn't really intended to be a title. All I wrote was "this one has such a raw, exposed feel to me that fits my mood of late" and I later decided that **raw, exposed** made a good title for this one.

![**raw, exposed** (version 09, seed 1869)](https://storage.googleapis.com/djnavarro-art/series-menacing-hearts/image/languid_09_1869.jpg)

The mood is obvious, to me at least. Compared to previous pieces the heart is so much larger, giving this feeling like the viewer is zooming in. Juxtaposed with those pieces it feels like the audience is encroaching on the subject. It feels like an invasion of personal space, and the bright bursts feel too bright, too much, and to my mind this one marks the end of a "phase" within the series. It's the point at which the soft, gentle feeling starts to go away. The love and warmth seems to be gone, stripped away leaving something else exposed. It feels uncomfortable.

## II. Rage

In the days that followed, my mood declined. Partly it was a reaction to the state of the world, but it was partly caused by nicotine withdrawal (that comes up again later). In truth, I'd stopped smoking six months ago, but because I'd given myself permission to use nicotine gum as much as I needed to, I hadn't actually made much progress on breaking the physiological addiction: all I'd been doing was getting the smoke out of my lungs and transferring the psychological cravings from the cigarettes to the gum. Worthy accomplishments, of course, but once I switched over to patches the amount of nicotine in my system started to plummet and withdrawal symptoms hit me really, really hard. I was tired all the time, I had trouble concentrating, and most of all I was having difficulty managing my emotions.

I felt angry, and I felt hopeless. When I shared this piece, I didn't post it directly. I'd sent it to a friend of mine via chat and bitterly remarked to her that I was **making my stupid art as if somehow it will make me feel better about fascism**. I know, I know, I'm not supposed to feel like that about my art. People tell me over and over that art matters even more in dark times, and that the art I share helps them cope with the feeling of dread they feel when yet another horrible news story breaks. That's lovely, but it doesn't help  me cope with my feelings of dread. That bitterness is what came through when messaging my friend, and when I shared the piece on social media the thing I shared was a screenshot of my message to her and not the piece itself.

![**making my stupid art as if somehow it will make me feel better about fascism** (version 18, seed 2762)](https://storage.googleapis.com/djnavarro-art/series-menacing-hearts/image/languid_18_2762.jpg)

As far as I can tell, this was the first time I shared one of these pieces that obscured the heart motif. It's there -- every piece generated by these systems contains the heart motif in some sense -- but the black smudges blot it out. It gets bleaker in the next piece, **waving tiny rainbow flags as the gender traitors are herded toward the gallows**. The intention behind the caption here isn't subtle. It is my bitterness about people who love to think they are allies to the LGBT community, but who remain deathly silent as our rights are eroded all over the world. 

![**waving tiny rainbow flags as the gender traitors are herded toward the gallows** (version 20, seed 2909)](https://storage.googleapis.com/djnavarro-art/series-menacing-hearts/image/languid_20_2909.jpg)

Neither of these two pieces feel emotionally connected to the earlier ones (not to me, at least). They're part of the same artistic series but the anger in these two pieces doesn't tie in with the themes of sex and love that were present there.

The next piece I shared, on the other hand...

![**her rapist got her pronouns right this time** (version 14, seed 2374)](https://storage.googleapis.com/djnavarro-art/series-menacing-hearts/image/languid_14_2374.jpg)

This one hurt. Visually, the red/green/black palette is intense but it's dark. The black stain in the middle blots out most of the heart, and the streaks feel more like slashes and cuts through the heart. The piece is striking, but it's not pleasant to me. 

I posted it with the caption **her rapist got her pronouns right this time**. 

I am still not sure why I did that. It's unfortunately autobiographical, and yes it bitterly references something that happened. Why I chose this moment and this piece to pivot into a darker and more personal place, I don't really know. But I did. Earlier in the series there was a sexual undertone that was joyful; now the art is speaking to rape. 

The reference to pronouns in the title isn't arbitrary either. One of the horrifying messages that trans women get sent by society is that we are "disposable women". We aren't "good women", we're the other kind. The ones that men are allowed to rape. More than that, we're taught to perceive our own rape as gender affirming: a man has validated my gender by treating me like a woman. Being raped is supposed to be a compliment, of sorts: it's proof that I'm enough of a woman that a man would want to rape me. These messages reverberate through my head every time I revisit my experiences with rape, and the rage I feel when these thoughts intrude upon my life is overwhelming.

With that as context, the superficial lightness of the next piece is a little jarring:

![**saccharine, sweet, and devoid of value** (version 13, seed 2214)](https://storage.googleapis.com/djnavarro-art/series-menacing-hearts/image/languid_13_2214.jpg)	

It was never posted with an explicit title, and at the time I posted it I was focused on this peculiar criticism that I see a lot online, namely that generative art can never really be art because it is machine generated. I don't agree with that claim at all, and when I posted this piece I did so with this as the alt text:

> sigh. okay look, this is another one of the "slightly menacing hearts" pieces i've been posting lately. and yes, it is generative art, the saccharine and bland stuff everyone on here loves to hate and deride. of course, the system is written entirely by myself in R and C++ as usual, and is not "trained" on anything at all, much less the work of other artists. because my work is of course utter garbage, the colour palette is very bright bloody pink and deep green, watermelon colours. see, red heart against green? so pretty, so nice... except the red heart has black rot in the middle, the colour is leeching into the surrounding canvas, and there are ugly slash marks marring the nice pretty background, as if something had corrupted something that should have been beautiful. perhaps the artist, quite publicly a repeated survivor of rape, is expressing a very human emotion through her machine-generated work? nope, can't be that, because all generative art is inherently soulless, lacking in artistic value, and we should never draw distinctions of any kind when making broad sweeping generalisations is so easy? 

The rape *is* present in this piece, just not as overtly as it was in the previous one. In the end I decided to call it **saccharine, sweet, and devoid of value** with two different intended interpretations: on the one hand it's a reference to what people wrongly think generative art is, but on the other hand it's also a nasty reference to how I'm supposed to think of myself as a trans woman. I am supposed to be sweet and nice just like one of the "good women", but nevertheless I am one of the "disposable women". In the language of the [Madonna/Whore complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna%E2%80%93whore_complex), trans women are *always* the whore. We exist to be sexually degraded, and can never aspire to be a high-status woman. 

## III. Shame

Given where my mood had taken me, is it any real surprise that feelings of shame and humiliation start to appear in the series? I posted these two pieces together with the caption **degradation**:

::: {layout-ncol=2}

![**degradation part 1** (version 30, seed 3075)](https://storage.googleapis.com/djnavarro-art/series-menacing-hearts/image/languid_30_3075.jpg)	

![**degradation part 2** (version 30, seed 3056)](https://storage.googleapis.com/djnavarro-art/series-menacing-hearts/image/languid_30_3056.jpg)

::: 

I suppose the intention here was to contrast the different feel that inverting the palette has in this version of the system. The white pieces on black background tended to be delicate and lovely, the black pieces on white background have a bleaker, coarser feel. It's not an inherent feature of white/black palettes of course, just something that emerged from the dynamics of this particular system variant, and it felt striking to me. 

Why call the joint piece **degradation** though? Only one of the two pieces feels degraded. My introspection fails me a little here: maybe it's a before the rape / after the rape distinction, or maybe it's another reference to the Madonna/Whore dynamic. I don't know for sure. One way or another though it is referring to sexual degradation. It does reference the way men treat me during sex, and how that treatment has trained me to confuse abuse with affection, and conflate desire with degradation. Above all else I have been taught to be ashamed of myself. In a moral universe shame should attach to the rapist; but we don't live in that universe. Shame is for the victims. 

The next piece I shared was this one:

![**wants me to tell him something pretty** (version 31, seed 3119)](https://storage.googleapis.com/djnavarro-art/series-menacing-hearts/image/languid_31_3119.jpg)

Once again, the title **wants me to tell him something pretty** provides interpretation. This piece completely obscures the heart motif, focusing instead on the black shapes blotting it out against the blood red background. It abandons the pretense that any of this is gentle or kind or loving. In artistic terms it is a deliberate repudiation of the same thing that **saccharine, sweet, and devoid of value** criticises. Art isn't always nice. It isn't always pretty. And the real world stories behind the art aren't always pretty either. Again, the "something pretty" aspect to the title partly references the expectation men have that women should make ourselves pretty for them, and rejects that too.

The specific phrasing is also a cultural reference. It is the final line spoken in the TV series [Deadwood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadwood_(TV_series)), delivered by Al Swearengen as he cleans up the blood of yet another murder, sourly commenting on the fact that after all the horrors, people still want to be told a pretty story.

Next came the triptych, **her presence is a blight on the natural order**:

::: {layout-ncol=3}

![**her presence is a blight on the natural order, part 1** (version 34, seed 3421)](https://storage.googleapis.com/djnavarro-art/series-menacing-hearts/image/languid_34_3421.jpg)

![**her presence is a blight on the natural order, part 2** (version 34, seed 3440)](https://storage.googleapis.com/djnavarro-art/series-menacing-hearts/image/languid_34_3440.jpg)

![**her presence is a blight on the natural order, part 3** (version 30, seed 3049)](https://storage.googleapis.com/djnavarro-art/series-menacing-hearts/image/languid_30_3049.jpg)

:::

It's not subtle. One of these pieces is not like the others. Two of them are beautiful, delicate, lovely pieces to be cherished and admired. The third is a degraded, bleak, ugly thing. Guess which one is me? Guess which one is the trans woman, the one whose mere presence is a blight upon the natural order? If images could feel shame, we all know which one should feel shame.

## IV. Dread

At this point I am going to slightly reorder the sequence of pieces from how I shared them on social media. There are two pieces I posted with captions that refer directly to the physiological experiences I was having at the time, **unmedicated anxiety** and **nicotine withdrawal**. I didn't post them explicitly as a pair, but it feels like they go naturally together:
