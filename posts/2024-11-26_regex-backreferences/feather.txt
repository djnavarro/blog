[Intro]
(Do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do)
(Do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do)
Oh, not another take

[Verse 1]
Oh, it's like that, I'm your dream come true
When it's on a platter for you
Then you pull back when I try to make plans
More than two hours in advance, mm

[Pre-Chorus]
I slam the door, I hit ignore
I'm saying, "No, no, no, no more"
I got you blocked, after this, an afterthought
I finally cut you off

[Chorus]
I feel so much lighter like a feather with you off my mind (Ah)
Floatin' through the memories like whatever, you're a waste of time (Ah)
Your signals are mixed, you act like a bitch
You fit every stereotype, "Send a pic"
I feel so much lighter like a feather with you out my life
With you out my life

[Post-Chorus]
(Do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do)
(Do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do)
Like a feather, like a feather, like a feather, yeah

[Verse 2]
It feels so good
Not carin' where you are tonight
And it feels so good
Not pretendin' to like the wine you like

[Pre-Chorus]
I slam the door (Slam the door), I hit ignore (Hit ignore)
I'm saying, "No, no, no, no more"
I got you blocked, excited to never talk, I
I'm so sorry for your loss

[Chorus]
I feel so much lighter like a feather with you off my mind (Ah)
Floatin' through the memories like whatever, you're a waste of time (Ah)
Your signals are mixed, you act like a bitch (A bitch)
You fit every stereotype, "Send a pic"
I feel so much lighter like a feather with you out my life
With you out my life

[Post-Chorus]
(Do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do)
Ah, mm
(Do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do)
Like a feather, like a feather, like a feather
[Bridge]
You want me? I'm done
You miss me? No duh
Where I'm at, I'm up where I'm at
You want me? I'm done (I'm done)
You miss me? No duh (No duh)
Where I'm at, I'm up (I'm up) where I'm at

[Outro]
You want me? I'm done
(I feel so much lighter like a feather with you off my mind)
You miss me? No duh
Where I'm at, I'm up where I'm at
(Like a feather, like a feather, like a feather)
You want me? I'm done
(I feel so much lighter like a feather with you off my mind)
You miss me? No duh
Where I'm at, I'm up where I'm at
(Like a feather, like a feather, like a feather, yeah)
