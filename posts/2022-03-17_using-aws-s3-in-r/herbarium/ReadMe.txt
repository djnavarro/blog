National Herbarium of NSW on AWS

High resolution images of the preserved plant specimens from the National Herbarium of NSW is for use via Amazon S3 under Creative Commons By Attribution licence (CC-BY). https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode
Biocollections metadata associated with each of the collection items is provided as open data and available as CC-0. Images were largely captured using a PhaseOne scanback at 100MP resolution and are available as JPG2000 format.
Specimens and low resolution images may be most easily searched using the ‘Atlas of Living Australia’ and ‘Australasian Virtual Herbarium’ platforms (https://collections.ala.org.au/collection/show/54). Packet and flat sheet specimens held by the National Herbarium of NSW (an estimated 1.4 million items as of January 2019) will be imaged and successively made available. The imaging and transcription of the collection will be completed by May 2021 with the full image and metadata collection being available shortly following completion of  quality control processes. 
New additions to the National Herbarium of NSW collection will be made available quarterly as additions are curated and imaged.

The digitisation project is a significant first step towards the relocation of the National Herbarium of NSW to a new facility at the Australian Botanic Garden Mount Annan, to create Australia’s leading botanic science precinct in 2021.
Amazon Web Services (AWS) has made the National Herbarium of NSW data freely available on Amazon S3 so that scientists, students, and the public alike may use the collection for biodiversity assessment, systematic botanical research, ecosystem conservation, policy development, for educational and other outreach tools.
