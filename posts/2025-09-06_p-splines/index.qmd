A [spline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spline_(mathematics)) is just a piecewise polynomial. Partition the interval $[a, b]$ into $k$ subintervals defined by **knot** points that demark the edges of each interval. The $i$-th subinterval is the region $[t_{_i-1}, t_i]$ and 

$$
a = t_0 \leq t_1 \leq t_2 \leq \ldots \leq t_k = b
$$
